Tableau Dashboard Outline for Invoice Risk Analysis
This Tableau dashboard will help finance teams track payment delays, identify high-risk invoices, and improve collections. Below is an outline of the key visualizations and KPIs to include.

1. Dashboard Title: Invoice Risk & Collection Analysis
Description: “Monitor overdue invoices, identify high-risk customers, and analyze payment trends to improve Accounts Receivables Turnover.”
Filters: Date Range (Due Date, Payment Date), Customer ID, Industry, Invoice Amount Range

2. Key Metrics (KPI Cards at the Top)
i. Total Outstanding Amount: SUM(invoice_amount) WHERE days_past_due > 0
ii) % of Late Payments: COUNT(late_invoices) / COUNT(total_invoices)
iii) Avg Days Late: AVG(days_past_due) WHERE days_past_due > 0
iv) High-Risk Invoices: COUNT(invoice_id) WHERE risk_score > 0.05

Goal: Provide at-a-glance financial health insights.

3. Risk Heatmap (Customer-Level)
Chart Type: Heatmap
X-Axis: Customer ID
Y-Axis: Total Outstanding Amount
Color Scale:
Red: High-risk customers (Many overdue invoices, high amounts)
Yellow: Moderate risk
Green: Low-risk customers

Goal: Identify which customers are frequently late with large overdue amounts.

4. Payment Delay Trend Analysis (Line Chart)
Chart Type: Line Chart
X-Axis: Month/Week
Y-Axis: Avg Days Late
Filters: Customer ID, Industry

Goal: Show trends in late payments over time. Identify if delays increase in specific months (seasonal trends).

5. High-Risk Invoice Breakdown (Bar Chart)
Chart Type: Bar Chart
X-Axis: Invoice Amount
Y-Axis: Days Past Due
Color: Risk Score (Darker = Higher Risk)

Goal: Identify high-value invoices with long delays to prioritize collection.

6. Drill-Down Table (Detailed Invoice Data)
Columns:
Invoice ID | Customer ID | Invoice Amount | Due Date | Payment Date | Days Past Due | Risk Score
Filters: Customer, Industry, Due Date Range

Goal: Finance teams can drill down into specific invoices and take action.

7. Automated Alerts & Recommendations
Logic: Highlight invoices approaching the overdue threshold (e.g., > 25 days).
Visualization: Dynamic Message Box
“Warning: X invoices are close to being overdue. Take action!”

Goal: Proactively notify collections teams about upcoming risks.

Next Steps
